# Python_AprilTags
Test code to evaluate OpenCV and PyPi Apriltags Python module to detect FRC vision targets.
More info on the Apriltags module is available here: https://pypi.org/project/apriltag/

Also, FRC has some good info on their page:
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/apriltag/apriltag-intro.html

This year's game (2023) Charged Up will use Apriltags as well as retro-reflective vision targets.
