# MARK'S JOURNAL

## 2025 05 07 MV: 
- CONTINUED effort
- RESEARCHED other NEWER libraries implementing AprilTags
- DISCOVERD pupil_apriltags as being NEWEST (2025) opted to test-drive THIS one... 
- INSTALLED pupil_apriltags via C$> pip install pupil_apriltags
- => SUCCESSFUL



## 2025 05 02 MV: 
- CONTINUED effort after working for past several WEEKS on other code
- STARTED camera (VERY IMPORTANT !!!)
- OPENED file Apriltag_video.py in editor
- RAN Apriltag_video.py using VSC's RUN button
- => WORKING !!! saw image, but didn't have any actual April Tags on me... 
- SAVED | COMMITTED | PUSHED
- PAUSED for the evening

## 2025 04 06 MV: 
- CONTINUED effort
- RESEARCHED "DroneKit" vs "MAVSDK"
- - BOTH are SDKs for MAXPROXY/MAVLINK - easy-to-use ABSTRACTIONS on top of difficult MAVProxy and MORE difficult MAVLink
- - DroneKit came out 2 year earlier (circa 2015 - by 3DR, the creators of ARUPILOT flightcontroller software and its APM flightcontroller hardware
- - MAVSDK and MAVSDK-Python came out circa 2019 by the MAVLink Project (creators of MAVLink, mavlink.org) to work with ARDUPILOT/APM and with PXR/Pixhawk 
- DECIDED to try & use MAVSDK FIRST for the UTC, before resortng to DroneKit
- REFERENCES: 
- - https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/main/en/index.html
- - https://mavsdk.mavlink.io/main/en/python/quickstart.html
- - https://github.com/mavlink/MAVSDK-Python
- - https://github.com/jonasvautherin/px4-gazebo-headless
- INSTALLED MAVSDK on RPi via $> pip3 install mavsdk 
- => SUCCESSFUL (no errors)
- INSTALLED aioconsole on RPi via $> pip3 install aioconsole
- => 




## 2025 04 01 MV: 
- CONTINUED effort
- BUILT a small POC using python "playsound" package 
- RECORDED MY OWN VOICE saying "north.mp3", "south.mp3", "east.mp3", "west.mp3" and "arrived.mp3" 
- TESTED
- => SUCCESSFUL ! WORKS GREAT with just playsound("north.mp3") etc etc
- CREATED new file "land_via_apriltags_audio.py" 
- ADDED code from Apriltag_video.py and playsound
- SUCCESSFULLY implemented audio feedback AND calculation of POSE (Position & Orientation) !!
- SUCCESSFULLY calculating ROLL PITCH & YAW in EULER ANGLES (+/- 180 degrees from N to S)
- SUCCESSFULLY running an AUDIO FEEDBACK LOOP that when you ROTATE an APRILTAG (equivalent to rotating the DRONE while the TAG remains FIXED) you get FEEDBACK to go "east" (CW) or "west" (CCW) or "arrived !!! 
- SAVED | COMMITTED | PUSHED 
- PAUSED for the evening - EXCELLENT PROGRESS !!!!!

## 2025 03 31 MV: 
- CONTINUED effort
- NEED some sort of SOUNDS to be generated by entire FC/RPI unit so that I can tell if I need to move my unit N S E W in order to get to a waypoint - that's the NEXT step in achieving AprilTag-based AUTO-LANDING
- FOUND code which uses numpy + pygame to generate tones; 
- RAN $> sudo raspi-config to set audio to 7in touchcreen's built-in speakers; 
- => PARTIALLY SUCCESSFUL - when tones run the DISPLAY BLANKS OUT :-( 
- CONNECTED EARPHONES to 3.5mm JACK & conigured audio to JACK instead
- => SUCCESSFUL ! can hear sounds out of BOTH earphones !!! 
- ORDERED external self-powered 3.5mm mini speaker instead
- NOW have generate_tone(Frequency, Duration) WORKING 
- SAVED | COMMITTED | PUSHED

## 2025 03 28 MV: 
- CONTINUED efforts to get Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller integrated with RPi (still installing code)
- NOTE: it appears that even when adhering to the best practice of employing python VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENTS (mine is /.venv/) there are STILL python packages which MUST also be installed at the SYSTEM/default/OS level, using "sudo apt-get install <package name>  - very confusing, except if you consider that these contain C++ code that must be BUILT for a SPECIFIC PLATFORM, and then the regular-schmegular python packages in /.venv/ EXPECT these system-level packages to be present ? 
- DELETED virtual environment /.venv - ONLY USING SYSTEM install of python !!! 
- REPEATED all package installs (including sudo apt-get installs of platform-specific packages) per the video listed in 2025 03 27

- REFERENCE: INSTALLED following packages using the exact commands provided ONE AT A TIME: 
-    Raspberry Pi:
-    $ sudo raspi-config
-    $ sudo nano /boot/config.txt
-    $ sudo reboot
-    $ sudo apt-get update
-    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
-    $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-opencv python3-wxgtk4.0 python3-matplotlib python3-lxml libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
-    $ sudo pip install PyYAML mavproxy
-    $ sudo mavproxy.py --master=/dev/ttyAMA0

- TRIED running > sudo mavproxy.py --master=/dev/tty/AMA0
- => UNSUCCESSFUL :-( threw errors 
- TRIED simply running mavproxy.py  (hoping it could AUTO-DETECT the presence of a flight controller)
- => SUCCESSFUL !!! detected the Pixhawk on "line 0" 
- UPDATED readme 
- SAVED | COMMITTED | PUSHED
- RE-TESTED running Apriltag_video.py using SYSTEM python
- => SUCCESSFUL - video window displayed ! AND AprilTags held up to RUNCAM6 WERE detected !!!!
- TRIED running $> mavproxy.py --quadcopter --console
- => SUCCESSFUL !!!!! 
- MAXPROXY.py actually IS an ENTIRE GCS; mostly CLI but it has MAP and HUD and OTHER functionality -it's probbably HALF of what I thought was in MISSION PLANNER, but MISSION PLANNER simply CALLS the FUNCTIONS that are IN MAXPROXY !!!! WHAT A REVELATION !!! 
- INSTALLED GPS antenna on pixhawuk (actually GPS + COMPASS built-in)
- => SUCCESS !!! all working !!! 
- NOW when run $> mavproxy.py --quadcopter --console and bring up HUD and MAP even my PIXHAWK displays on the MAP in my CUL de SAC as "HOME" and I can walk around with the entire unit (including 7 in touchscreen display!) over inthe cul de sac and I SEE my drone MOVE IN THE MAP !!!! 
- happy happy happy 
- PAUSED for evening 

## 2025 03 27 MV: 
- CONTINUED self-study
- FOUND BETTER video series to follow RE: how to connect Pixhawk 2.4.8 flight controller to RPi4 
- using Pixhawk Telemetry1 connector to 3-wires on RPi4's GPIO pin block!
- REFERENCE: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIuoCYauW3s&t=6s  (watched on Rpi w NO audio; lip-read and read video description notes)
- ORDERED set of pixhawk telemetry connector-to-GPIO female pins on Amazon
- CONNECTED 6-pin connector to pixhawk Telemetry2 connector
- CONNECTED BLK wire to RPi GPIO GND (pin 9)
- CONNECTED WHT wire (Tx) to RPi GPIO Rx (pin 10)
- CONNECTED BLU wire (Rx) to RPi GPIO Tx (pin 8)
- TRIED powering Pixhawk by connecting RED wire (5V) to RPi GPIO 5V (pin 2) => NOTHING HAPPENED; Pixhawk DIDN'T POWER ON
- DISCONNECTED my "Coral" USB-connecte external GPU (running non-stop for MORE THAN 2 YEARS NOW) from USB3 port of RPi
- CONNECTED Pixhawk by connecting mini-USB to RPi USB3 (blue USB) 
- => SUCCESS !!! Pixhawk IMMEIDATELY POWERED ON ! :-) 
- UPDATED readme
- SAVED | COMMITTED | PUSHED 
- CHARGED new RUNCAM6 sports cam from Michael 
- UNINSTALLED existing USB webcam (LogiTech) from USB port of RPi
- INSTALLED RUNCAM6 into RPi USB2 port using provided USB-micro to USB-A 10 inch cable 
- LEFT CAM port set to 0 since STILL the ONLY camera connected
- RAN Apriltag_video.py using VSC "run" button
- => WORKING !!!!
- PAUSED for few hours (tennis break on a Friday afternoon/evening)
- CONTINUED with Pixhawk-to-RPi integration
- CONTINUED installation of various python modules into virtual env  /.venv 
- REALIZED I MIGHT have been installing much of what's required into the SYSTEM install of PYTHON3 :-O !!! 
- - pip list on /.venv shows only about 7 packages installed :-( 
- - pip list in OS terminal windows (NOT integrated terminal in VSC) shows DOZENS of packages installed :-O !!! 
- WHAT TO DO ???
- HOW BEST TO PROCEED ??? 
- DECISION: continue install of remaining packages into but /.venv  (virtual environment - NOT system/default env)
- performed (.venv) > pip install PyYAML
- => SUCCESSFULLY installed in (.venv)!
- performed (.venv) > pip install mavproxy
- => SUCCESSFULLY instlled in (.venv) ! - INCLUDING all auto-detected DEPENDENCIES (but not those mentioned in the video???)
- IMPORTANT NOTE: sudo pip install performs a SYSTEM install and throws EXCEPTTIOS; regular-schmegular (.venv) pip install <packages> works!
-- performed (.venv) > pip install wxPython in lieu of SYSTEM install of python3-wxgtk4.0
- => ERRORS; but (.venv) > pip list shows wxPython IS installed !!! 
- PAUSED for evening


## 2025 03 08 MV: 
- CONTINUED self-study
- CREATED env ".venv"
- OPENED terminal with .venv activated
- pip install apriltag
- => ERROR: "Missing CMake" ? 
-    LEARNED this is a utility for CUSTOM-BUILDING pip install WHL files for python modules which contain "native" - HANDY !!
- pip install cmake => successful
- pip install opencv-python (contains CV2) => successful
- pip install apriltag => successful 
- SAVE | COMMIT | PUSH to github.com
- INSTALLED NEW WIFI ROUTER in house Netgear Nighthawk 
- UPDATED VSC on RPi using following download (for ARM64): https://update.code.visualstudio.com/latest/linux-deb-arm64/stable
- SWITCHED to new 5G WiFi network NETGEAR-41-5G
- SNAPPED pics of progress and TEXTED to MCV
- SAVE | COMMIT | PUSH to github.com
- SWITCHED CAMERAS !!! 
- - LEFT the "legacy" camera installed (port 0, not returning valid frames)
- - INSTALLED ordinary USB web cap (kind that clips onto laptop lid or top edge of external display) onto RPi's only USB3 port; 
- - CONFIGURED code so cam = cv2.VideoCapture(1)
- ADDED some additional exception-handling (really exception-printing is all) code just after cam.read()
- RAN Apriltag_video.py using VSC's RUN button
- => WORKING !!!!! 
- - a small pop-up window displays with a near-streaming picture first of whatever the CAMERA SEES, then IF there are AprilTags (ok to have SEVERAL) then it will: 
- - - DETECT each tag; 
- - - DRAW small green squares on the CORNERS of each AprilTag to PROVE that it UNDERSTANDS WHERE these corners ARE; and 
- - - DRAW the TAG ID in the CENTER of each AprilTag to PROVE that it UNDERSTANDS WHERE this center is as well ! 
- DEMO-ed to Michael
- UPDATED README
- SAVE | COMMIT | PUSH to github.com 
- PAUSED for the evening - need to R&D how to use this capability to help a DRONE carrying a 10 lb PAYLOAD LAND on a MOVING BOAT and MOVE VEHICLE !

# Python_AprilTags
Test code to evaluate OpenCV and PyPi Apriltags Python module to detect FRC vision targets.
More info on the Apriltags module is available here: https://pypi.org/project/apriltag/

Also, FRC has some good info on their page:
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/apriltag/apriltag-intro.html

This year's game (2023) Charged Up will use Apriltags as well as retro-reflective vision targets.
